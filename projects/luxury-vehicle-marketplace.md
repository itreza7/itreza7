# Luxury Vehicle Marketplace API Platform

## Project Overview

The Luxury Vehicle Marketplace API is a containerized RESTful service designed for a luxury marketplace specializing in vehicles from movies and series, including helicopters and specialized tools. Built with FastAPI and SQLModel, the platform manages a comprehensive catalog of collectible vehicles and memorabilia with advanced search capabilities, secure authentication, and integrated media management.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Infrastructure
- **Framework**: FastAPI with SQLModel for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized schemas for collectible items
- **Authentication**: Stateless JWT with access/refresh token rotation
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage for high-resolution vehicle images
- **Containerization**: Full Docker ecosystem with development/production parity
- **API Design**: Versioned `/v1` endpoint hierarchy with comprehensive OpenAPI documentation

### System Design
The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI application with mounted routers and auto-generated documentation
- **Core Services**: Configuration management, database sessions, security, and logging
- **Data Models**: SQLModel classes for vehicles, memorabilia, and metadata relationships
- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response serialization
- **Business Logic**: Encapsulated services for CRUD operations and file management
- **Routing**: Modular endpoint organization by resource domain
- **Utilities**: Dynamic filtering, pagination, slug generation, and cloud storage integration

## Key Technical Features

### Advanced Search & Filtering
- Multi-attribute filtering on array fields (genres, vehicle types, production years)
- Dynamic query building for complex search combinations
- Optimized database queries for large catalog browsing

### Media Management
- Automated S3 bucket synchronization with database records
- Bulk import functionality for vehicle image collections
- Efficient file upload/deletion with metadata tracking

### Security Implementation
- JWT-based authentication with claim validation (`iat`, `exp`, `jti`)
- Token revocation mechanisms to prevent replay attacks
- Auto-provisioned admin credentials for secure system initialization

### DevOps & Deployment
- Docker Compose environment for local development (PostgreSQL + MinIO)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Container registry integration for seamless deployments
- Environment-agnostic configuration management

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLModel/SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with advanced indexing
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage (MinIO for development)
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh token rotation
- **Testing**: pytest with httpx for integration testing
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, comprehensive type hints
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger UI with interactive testing

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient array field querying for multi-valued vehicle attributes
- Pagination implementation for large catalog browsing
- Optimized database relationships and indexing strategies

### Integration Solutions
- S3 bucket state synchronization with database consistency
- Spreadsheet import utility for bulk vehicle registration
- Idempotent import routines with validation checks

### Development Experience
- Zero-configuration local setup via Docker Compose
- Comprehensive API documentation with interactive testing
- Modular codebase structure for maintainability and extensibility

## Project Outcomes

Delivered a production-ready luxury vehicle marketplace API with:
- Comprehensive catalog management for movie/series vehicles
- Secure, scalable authentication system
- Efficient media handling for high-quality vehicle imagery
- Full containerization for consistent deployment across environments
- Automated CI/CD pipeline ensuring code quality and deployment reliability

The platform successfully handles complex inventory management requirements specific to luxury collectible vehicles while maintaining high performance and security standards.
