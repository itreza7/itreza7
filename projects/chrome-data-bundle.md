# ChromeData Integration Microservice

## Project Overview

High-performance RESTful microservice for automotive data integration, featuring media gallery processing and real-time data synchronization. Handles 10,000+ daily API requests with automated background processing, scheduled data updates, and event-driven architecture. Achieved 99.9% uptime with zero-downtime deployment capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Design
* **Microservice Framework**: FastAPI-based REST API with async request handling and automatic OpenAPI documentation
* **Modular Structure**: Clean separation of concerns across configuration, models, controllers, routes, schemas, and background services
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery worker system with Redis message broker for distributed task execution
* **Event-Driven Design**: Redis pub/sub consumer for real-time event processing and data normalization
* **Containerized Deployment**: Multi-stage Docker builds with optimized dependency management

### Technology Stack
* **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, Pydantic
* **Async Processing**: Celery 5.x with Redis broker and beat scheduler
* **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling and health monitoring
* **Integration**: REST/SOAP API clients with retry logic and circuit breakers
* **Infrastructure**: Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD, environment-based configuration
* **Testing**: pytest with 90%+ code coverage

## Key Technical Achievements

### Performance & Reliability
* **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Implemented graceful startup/shutdown handlers with database connectivity validation
* **Efficient Resource Management**: Designed singleton pattern for external API clients with connection pooling and exponential backoff retry logic
* **Data Deduplication**: Built content-based hashing system to prevent duplicate entries in high-volume data streams
* **Optimized Scheduling**: Implemented idempotent task patterns with distributed locking to eliminate race conditions

### System Optimization
* **Container Performance**: Reduced Docker image size by 40% through multi-stage builds and strategic dependency caching
* **Error Handling**: Implemented circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation for external service failures
* **Monitoring**: Integrated structured logging with correlation IDs and comprehensive health check endpoints
* **Scalability**: Designed horizontal scaling capabilities with stateless service architecture

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Critical Problem Resolution
* **Database Connectivity**: Eliminated silent startup failures through synchronous health checks with controlled shutdown mechanisms
* **High-Volume Deduplication**: Solved duplicate data storage using in-memory sets and content hashing algorithms for real-time processing
* **Task Scheduling Conflicts**: Prevented data corruption from overlapping scheduled tasks using distributed locking and state management
* **Deployment Reliability**: Achieved consistent builds through reproducible container environments and automated dependency management

### Integration Complexity
* **Multi-Protocol Support**: Successfully integrated both REST and SOAP APIs with unified error handling and response normalization
* **Event Processing**: Built robust message normalization system handling various event formats and data schemas
* **Automated Workflows**: Designed scheduled data refresh pipelines with configurable intervals and failure recovery

## Measurable Results

### Performance Metrics
* **Uptime**: 99.9% service availability with comprehensive monitoring
* **Processing Speed**: Reduced data processing time from hours to minutes through automation
* **Resource Optimization**: 30% reduction in infrastructure costs through efficient container deployment
* **Development Velocity**: Enabled rapid feature development through modular architecture and automated testing

### Quality Achievements
