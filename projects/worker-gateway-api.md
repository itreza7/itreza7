# Gateway API

## Project Overview

High-performance serverless API gateway built on Cloudflare Workers, providing unified entry point for multiple client websites and applications. Handles dynamic routing, caching, authentication, content translation, form processing, file uploads, and background tasks at the network edge to deliver low-latency, scalable services.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Infrastructure
- **Serverless Edge Compute:** Cloudflare Workers for global distribution with consistent low-latency responses
- **Regex-Based Routing:** Centralized route pattern configuration dispatching to specialized handler functions
- **Modular Design:** Domain-organized handlers (cache, website, inventory, forms) for maintainable business logic
- **Utility Libraries:** Shared functions for HTTP abstraction, JWT authentication, KV caching, and middleware orchestration

### Data & Processing
- **State Management:** Cloudflare KV for data persistence
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Cloudflare Queues for non-blocking background tasks (cache invalidation, Next.js revalidation)
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI 3.1 specification with embedded Swagger UI for interactive documentation

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler CLI
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- **Testing:** Vitest with @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- **Storage:** Cloudflare KV, Cloudflare Queues
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI 3.1, Swagger UI

## Key Technical Achievements

### Performance Optimization
- **Sub-50ms Response Times:** Minimized cold starts through bundle optimization and dependency reduction
- **Dynamic Caching Strategy:** Implemented granular TTL controls per endpoint with KV-backed caching middleware
- **Edge Computing:** Achieved global low-latency through strategic edge distribution

### Security & Authentication
- **JWT Implementation:** Secure authentication layer with role-based access controls
- **Input Validation:** Robust form and file handling with comprehensive error handling
- **Secure File Uploads:** Multipart form submission endpoints with validation

### Developer Experience
- **Custom Routing Engine:** Flexible regex-driven router simplifying endpoint addition
- **Interactive Documentation:** Self-service API documentation reducing developer onboarding time
- **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive test suite with Workers runtime compatibility

### Advanced Features
- **Real-time Internationalization:** On-the-fly content translation and image localization at edge
- **Background Task Framework:** Queue-based handlers for multi-step processes without blocking main requests
- **Cache Management:** Automated cache purging and Next.js ISR revalidation workflows

## Technical Challenges Solved

- **Cold Start Optimization:** Achieved consistent performance through strategic bundle size management
- **Asynchronous Coordination:** Engineered queue-based workflows for complex multi-step operations
- **Environment Consistency:** Standardized configuration across development, staging, and production environments
- **Scalability:** Designed system to handle multiple client applications with varying requirements

## Project Impact

- **Performance:** Delivered consistent sub-50ms response times globally
- **Scalability:** Enabled seamless handling of multiple client applications
- **Developer Productivity:** Reduced API integration time through comprehensive documentation
- **Maintenance:** Achieved high maintainability through modular architecture
- **Reliability:** Implemented robust error handling and background processing for improved user experience
