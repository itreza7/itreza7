# Dashboard Microservice â€“ Enterprise Data Management Platform

## Project Overview
A Python-based microservice platform designed for enterprise data aggregation, analytics, and visualization. The system features advanced bulk rules management, user administration, dynamic forms, and comprehensive lead tracking capabilities.

## Technical Architecture
**Backend Framework:** Python 3.11 with SQLAlchemy ORM  
**Database:** PostgreSQL with timezone-aware data handling  
**Deployment:** Docker containerization for scalability  
**API Design:** RESTful endpoints with modular microservice architecture

### Core Design Patterns
- Microservice separation for maintainability and deployment flexibility
- Base model inheritance for schema consistency
- UUID-based identification with timezone-aware timestamps
- ORM relationships for complex data modeling

## Key Features Implemented

### Bulk Rules Engine
- Designed flexible rule definition models supporting external resource references
- Implemented incentive management system for complex business criteria
- Built rule application engine for processing large datasets efficiently
- Created special/website rule variants for different use cases

### User Management & Security
- Developed comprehensive user model with multi-language and currency support
- Implemented role-based access control with granular permissions
- Built user-to-dealer association mapping for hierarchical access
- Created secure permission retrieval algorithms

### Dynamic Forms System
- Architected flexible form builder with custom field support
- Implemented cascading relationships and dynamic field ordering
- Built form validation engine with dealer-specific compliance checks
- Created template-based form generation system

### Lead Management Workflow
- Developed lead tracking system with form integration
- Implemented document association and status management
- Built unified workflow linking leads to dealers and forms
- Created conversion tracking and follow-up automation

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Complex Data Processing
**Challenge:** Applying business rules across heterogeneous datasets  
**Solution:** Standardized rule schemas with optimized query logic and batch processing

### Security & Access Control
**Challenge:** Implementing granular permission system across multiple entities  
**Solution:** Built association mapping algorithms with role-based access patterns

### Dynamic Data Modeling
**Challenge:** Creating flexible, extensible form and data structures  
**Solution:** Leveraged ORM relationships with dynamic field generation and validation

### Performance & Scalability
**Challenge:** Maintaining performance with growing data volume  
**Solution:** Containerized deployment with optimized database queries and caching strategies

## Business Impact
- **Automation:** Reduced manual rule processing time by implementing bulk operations
