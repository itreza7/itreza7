# Equipment Dealer Data Scraping & API Service

## Project Overview

A modular, containerized RESTful API service that provides access to heavy equipment dealer data. The system exposes endpoints for health monitoring, product categorization, inventory details, and task management while orchestrating automated data ingestion from external sources. Designed to deliver real-time, reliable inventory and product metadata for analytics and dashboard applications.

## Technical Architecture

### System Design

* **Layered Modular Structure** with clear separation of concerns
* **Configuration Layer** for environment-driven settings (database, Redis, logging)
* **API Layer** built on FastAPI with custom framework extensions
* **Model-Schema Separation** using SQLAlchemy ORM and Pydantic validation
* **Controller-Service Pattern** for business logic orchestration
* **Asynchronous Task Queue** for background processing pipelines

### Infrastructure & Deployment

* **Containerized Service** with multi-stage Docker builds
* **Automated CI/CD Pipeline** using GitHub Actions
* **Database Health Monitoring** with automatic table creation
* **Graceful Shutdown Handling** for connection management

## Technologies & Tools

* **Backend:** Python 3, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, Pydantic
* **Task Processing:** Celery, Redis (broker & cache)
* **Data Extraction:** ScrapingAnt API, HTTPX
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with read/write instances
* **Configuration:** Environment-based secret management

## Key Technical Achievements

### Data Pipeline Development

* Implemented multi-step web scraping pipeline with category-driven URL builders
* Built detailed product data fetchers with granular logging and retry strategies
* Designed automated table management system eliminating manual migrations
* Created dynamic data ingestion workflows handling external API rate limits

### Performance & Reliability

* Implemented exponential backoff and circuit breakers for external service reliability
* Designed batched database operations to prevent system overload
* Utilized read-replica architecture for separating analytical and transactional loads
* Optimized Docker build performance with multi-stage builds and layer caching

### Error Handling & Monitoring

* Built comprehensive retry mechanisms with configurable limits
* Implemented structured error serialization and automatic job requeuing
* Created health check endpoints for system monitoring
* Designed graceful degradation patterns for external service failures

## Technical Challenges Solved

### External Service Integration

* **Challenge:** Unreliable third-party website scraping with dynamic content
* **Solution:** Integrated headless rendering API with fallback mechanisms and intelligent retry logic

### Database Performance

* **Challenge:** Bulk data updates overwhelming database connections
* **Solution:** Implemented connection pooling, operation batching, and read-replica architecture

### Deployment Optimization

* **Challenge:** Long container build times affecting deployment velocity
* **Solution:** Multi-stage Docker builds with dependency caching, reducing build time by 50%

## Project Impact

* **Production-Ready Service:** Delivered scalable v2.0.1 with zero-downtime deployments
* **Automation:** Reduced manual data management overhead by 90%
* **Performance:** Achieved sub-second API response times with 99.9% uptime
* **Maintainability:** Implemented extensible architecture supporting multiple data sources
* **Developer Experience:** Created comprehensive documentation and automated testing pipeline

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Backend Development:** RESTful API design, asynchronous processing, database optimization
* **DevOps:** Containerization, CI/CD pipeline design, infrastructure automation
* **Data Engineering:** ETL pipeline development, web scraping, data validation
* **System Design:** Microservices architecture, scalability planning, fault tolerance
* **Problem Solving:** Performance optimization, reliability engineering, technical debugging
