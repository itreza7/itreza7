# Automotive Feed Management Microservice

## Project Overview

A Python-based microservice for automated generation, scheduling, and delivery of automotive inventory feeds. The system provides secure REST APIs for feed management, orchestrates background processing tasks, and integrates with external inventory systems to serve thousands of dealers.

## Technical Architecture

### API Layer
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async/await patterns for high-performance request handling
- **Servers**: Uvicorn (development) and Gunicorn (production) for optimal deployment flexibility
- **Authentication**: Token-based security with role-based access control
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and liveness probes

### Asynchronous Processing
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker for distributed job processing
- **Scheduling**: Configurable periodic tasks with retry policies and timeout safeguards
- **Concurrency**: Optimized worker pools to handle high-frequency operations
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time monitoring with Redis-backed event system

### Data Management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling and transaction management
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and temporary data storage
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management with secrets handling

### Integration Layer
- **Vendor Abstractions**: Pluggable modifier framework for third-party system integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry mechanisms and circuit breaker patterns
- **Data Transformation**: Flexible feed templating system supporting multiple output formats

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Celery, SQLAlchemy
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Testing**: Pytest with unit and integration test coverage
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging with centralized log aggregation
