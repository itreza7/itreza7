# Crypto Payment Gateway

## Overview

A secure, high-performance cryptocurrency payment gateway enabling businesses to accept and manage digital payments across multiple blockchains. The system provides REST API endpoints for integration and an administrative dashboard for transaction monitoring, handling payment creation, on-chain confirmation, and balance reconciliation.

## Technical Architecture

### API Layer
- **REST API**: FastAPI-based service with Pydantic schema validation for payment initiation, status validation, and wallet management
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system using python-jose
- **Request Handling**: Uvicorn/Gunicorn ASGI deployment optimized for high concurrency

### Blockchain Integration
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Unified interface for Ethereum (ERC-20), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20), and Tron (TRC-20) networks
- **Blockchain SDKs**: Web3.py for Ethereum, Tronpy for Tron, custom BEP-20 integration modules
- **Transaction Processing**: Real-time balance monitoring, QR code generation, and payment confirmation

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM for type-safe operations
- **Schema Design**: Optimized relational models for wallets, transactions, and user management
- **Session Management**: Centralized session factory with connection pooling

### Background Processing
- **Scheduler**: APScheduler with PostgreSQL jobstore for distributed task execution
- **Wallet Management**: Automated wallet allocation, payment polling, and resource cleanup
- **Reconciliation**: Minute-interval jobs for on-chain/off-chain balance synchronization

### Frontend Dashboard
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templating engine with Bootstrap 5 UI framework
- **Features**: Transaction monitoring, wallet status tracking, system analytics
- **Interactivity**: Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic QR code rendering and real-time updates

## Technologies

**Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, APScheduler, python-dotenv  
**Blockchain**: Web3.py, Tronpy, custom smart contract wrappers  
**Database**: PostgreSQL, psycopg2, SQLAlchemy-Utils  
**Infrastructure**: Uvicorn, Gunicorn, JWT authentication  
**Frontend**: Jinja2, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
