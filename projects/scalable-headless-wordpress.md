## Scalable Headless WordPress CMS with Docker & S3 Integration

### Overview

Developed a custom WordPress plugin and containerized environment that transforms a traditional WordPress site into a headless CMS, enabling content to be consumed via REST APIs by modern front-end frameworks. Media assets (images, videos, documents) are offloaded to Amazon S3 and served through CloudFront, ensuring near-infinite scalability, reduced server load, and seamless deployment across environments.

### Role & Responsibilities

* **Lead Engineer & Plugin Author**: Architected and implemented the plugin’s core functionality, from media upload hooks to S3/CloudFront integration.
* **DevOps & Containerization Specialist**: Designed and maintained Docker configurations—including Dockerfiles, Docker Compose setups, and health-check scripts—to standardize development, testing, and production workflows.
* **CI/CD Integrator**: Collaborated with the DevOps team to integrate automated builds and deployments, ensuring each change passed through linting, unit tests, and container health checks before release.

### Architecture & Design

* **Modular Plugin Structure**: Organized the codebase into clear components for upload interception, API extension, and cloud storage adapters, facilitating future enhancements and third-party integrations.
* **Environment-Driven Configuration**: Leveraged environment variables for database credentials, S3 bucket details, and CDN endpoints—eliminating hard-coded secrets and streamlining deployment to staging and production clusters.
* **Container Topology**:

  * **PHP-FPM Container** with custom PHP settings optimized for media processing and REST throughput.
  * **Nginx Reverse Proxy** handling SSL termination, caching, and request routing to PHP-FPM.
  * **MySQL Database** container with persistent storage volumes.
  * **Health-Check Service** executing lightweight HTTP probes to verify container readiness and trigger automated restarts.

### Technologies Used

* **WordPress & PHP**: Plugin development, REST API extensions, AWS SDK for PHP
* **Docker & Docker Compose**: Container definitions, multi-stage builds, inter-service networking
* **AWS S3 & CloudFront**: Media storage and global CDN distribution for high availability and low latency
* **Bash & Shell Scripting**: Automated startup tasks, permission management, and plugin deployment routines
* **Git & CI/CD Pipelines**: Version control with GitLab CI for automated testing, container builds, and rollbacks

### Key Contributions & Solutions

* **Headless API Enhancements**: Extended WordPress REST endpoints to expose custom fields and taxonomy data, enabling richer content modeling for front-end applications.
* **Robust Media Offload**: Intercepted WordPress upload events to stream files directly to S3, generating signed URLs for secure delivery through CloudFront and invalidating caches on content updates.
* **Optimized Container Builds**: Employed multi-stage Docker builds to minimize final image size, automated dependency installation, and applied best-practice PHP configurations to reduce startup time and memory usage.
* **Automated Health Monitoring**: Created lightweight scripts that perform periodic HTTP checks against key endpoints, alerting on failures and triggering self-healing container restarts, significantly improving reliability.

### Challenges & Resolutions

* **Consistent Cache Invalidation**: Ensured cloudfront caches reflected the latest media by programmatically generating invalidation batches only for updated assets, avoiding full-distribution purges and reducing costs.
* **Environment Parity**: Addressed “works on my machine” issues by codifying every dependency and configuration in Docker, resulting in identical development, staging, and production environments.
* **Scalability Under Load**: Tuned PHP-FPM worker counts and implemented object caching at the proxy layer to handle traffic spikes without manual intervention.

### Outcome

Delivered a production-ready, horizontally scalable WordPress solution that decouples content management from front-end delivery. The plugin and container setup have been adopted across multiple projects, reducing infrastructure costs, accelerating deployment times, and providing a clear upgrade path for future headless implementations.
