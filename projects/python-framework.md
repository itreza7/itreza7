# Python Microservices Framework (dtpyfw)

## Project Overview

A modular, extensible Python toolkit designed to standardize and streamline common service-level patterns across microservices architecture. The framework provides reusable sub-packages covering configuration management, database connectivity (both synchronous and asynchronous via SQLAlchemy), object storage operations, file transfer (FTP abstraction), messaging (Redis and Kafka integration), background processing, structured logging, and encryption utilities (secure password hashing and JWT support). By abstracting repetitive boilerplate code, the framework accelerates development velocity and ensures consistency across diverse service implementations.

## Technical Architecture

The framework adopts a clean, modular architecture with each sub-package encapsulating specific capabilities:

### Core Modules
* **Core**: Environment variable management, HTTP API wrappers, centralized exception handling, dependency injection utilities, and singleton support
* **API**: FastAPI integration with request/response models, routing, and injectable dependencies
* **DB**: Fluent configuration builder, unified `DatabaseInstance` for sync/async sessions, shared `ModelBase` with UUID primary keys and timestamp fields, health checks, dynamic query filters, and bulk upsert utilities
* **Bucket**: Abstracted object storage client providing a common interface for cloud storage providers
* **FTP**: Configurable FTP client with connection pooling, robust retry logic, and file transfer abstractions
* **Redis & Kafka**: Messaging clients for command and event-driven patterns, including serialization helpers and automated test fixtures
* **Worker**: Generic task scheduler and execution engine supporting prioritized queues and pluggable worker strategies
* **Log**: Structured logging configuration with contextual metadata injection and integration adapters for external log aggregators
* **Encrypt**: Secure password hashing utilities and JWT token management following industry best practices

Each module exposes consistent, intuitive interfaces and supports seamless transition between synchronous and asynchronous workflows.

## Technology Stack

* **Python 3.11+** for modern language features and performance optimization
* **Poetry** for dependency management, packaging, and version isolation
* **SQLAlchemy** for ORM-based database interactions with both sync and async support
* **FastAPI** for building high-performance HTTP APIs
* **Pytest** with fixtures and coverage reporting for comprehensive test coverage
* **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation, including automated package publishing
* **Redis & Kafka** native Python clients for implementing messaging patterns
* **Cloud Storage SDKs** abstracted for bucket operations across multiple providers
* **Structured Logging** libraries (Loguru/built-in) for enhanced observability
* **Security Libraries** (Passlib for hashing, PyJWT for tokens) for secure authentication

## Key Technical Achievements
