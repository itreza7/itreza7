# DigitalOcean API Integration Microservice

A modular microservice for programmatic management of DigitalOcean App Platform resources. Features versioned REST endpoints for application listing, retrieval, and domain management with automated CI/CD deployment pipeline.

## Technical Implementation

* **Microservice Architecture:** Built modular two-tier structure with `MainApp` aggregating versioned sub-applications and `SubApp` instances for each API version
* **API Design:** Implemented RESTful endpoints with router-controller pattern, Pydantic schema validation, and environment-to-UUID mapping
* **Security:** Integrated API key authentication middleware and environment-based configuration management
* **Client Integration:** Abstracted DigitalOcean API client (`pydo`) behind reusable utility wrapper with centralized token management

## Technologies & Tools

* **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI (custom `dtfpy` framework), Pydantic for validation
* **Cloud Integration:** DigitalOcean API (`pydo` client), App Platform management
* **DevOps:** Docker multi-stage builds, GitHub Actions CI/CD, automated container registry deployment
* **Configuration:** python-dotenv, environment-driven secrets management

## Key Features & Solutions

* **Concurrent API Versioning:** Designed backward-compatible versioning system supporting multiple API versions simultaneously
* **Idempotent Domain Management:** Implemented domain-add handler with existence verification to prevent duplicates and atomic spec updates
* **Automated Deployment:** GitHub Actions pipeline with commit SHA tagging and private registry publishing
* **Error Prevention:** Pydantic Enum mappers validate user input and fetch corresponding UUIDs, reducing runtime failures
* **Performance Optimization:** Pre-check logic eliminates redundant network calls and improves API rate utilization

## Results

* Delivered production-ready microservice enabling programmatic DigitalOcean application management
* Established foundation for future API extensions and cloud resource integrations
* Implemented secure, scalable architecture with comprehensive CI/CD automation
