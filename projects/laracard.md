## Laracard - Digital Goods E-commerce Package

### Project Overview

A modular Laravel package that transforms any Laravel application into a turnkey digital goods storefront. Provides a robust platform for selling recharge cards, gift cards, software licenses, and online account vouchers with enterprise-grade reliability and rapid integration capabilities.

### Technical Architecture

#### Modular Service Provider System

* **CoreProvider:** Package bootstrapping, asset publishing, migration registration
* **GatewayProvider:** Dynamic payment gateway bindings via unified interface
* **AdminProvider & StorefrontProvider:** Separated backend/frontend concerns with clean boundaries

#### Event-Driven Architecture

* Laravel Events (`CardPurchased`, `CouponApplied`) with Listeners for audit logging and notifications
* Webhook system for real-time order processing and external system integration

#### Performance & Scalability

* Redis caching for category hierarchies and card metadata
* Optimistic locking and atomic inventory checks preventing oversells during high-traffic scenarios
* Database indexing strategy for foreign keys, unique codes, and timestamp queries

### Key Technologies

* **Backend:** Laravel 10, PHP 8.x, Composer
* **Payment Integration:** Abstracted gateway interface supporting Stripe, PayPal, IDPay
* **Security:** CSRF protection, reCAPTCHA v3, Spatie Role-Permission RBAC
* **Caching:** Redis for performance optimization
* **DevOps:** Docker Compose, GitHub Actions CI/CD, automated testing pipelines
* **Monitoring:** Monolog with Slack alerts, Laravel Telescope debugging

### Core Features Implemented

#### Advanced Promotion Engine

* Multi-tier coupon system (percentage, fixed-amount, tiered, "buy X get Y")
* Rule-builder pattern for conditional promotions (cart value, user roles, date ranges)
* Dynamic JSON-driven pricing rules with time-based modifiers

#### API & Integration Layer

* RESTful endpoints for headless integrations (mobile apps, SPAs)
* Rate limiting, token authentication, CORS configuration
* Webhook notifications for ERP and fulfillment system integration

#### Administrative Features

* Live-filter tables for orders, cards, and coupons management
* Bulk CSV/JSON import for inventory management
* On-demand sales reporting (CSV/XLSX export)
* Real-time dashboard metrics and customer segmentation

#### Multi-Currency & Localization

* Internal wallet system with preloaded balance functionality
* Laravel Localization for multilingual storefronts
* GeoIP-based currency formatting and locale detection

### Technical Challenges Solved

* **Concurrency Management:** Implemented atomic operations and optimistic locking to prevent inventory overselling during flash sales
* **Internationalization:** Automated translation pipeline with string extraction and locale synchronization
* **Scalability:** Designed extensible plugin hooks while maintaining clear module boundaries

### Console Commands & Automation

* **CleanupCommand:** Automated expired order and cart cleanup
* **ExpireCardsCommand:** Card lifecycle management and archiving
* **NotifyUsersCommand:** Automated expiration alerts and low-stock warnings

### Security & Compliance

* Immutable audit trails for all critical operations
* Comprehensive validation rules for transactional safety
* Role-based access control with granular permissions

### Results

Successfully delivered a production-ready, scalable Laravel package demonstrating expertise in modular architecture design, high-performance e-commerce systems, and enterprise-level software development practices.
