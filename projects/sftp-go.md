# Secure File Transfer Service (SFTPGo)

## Project Overview

Enterprise-grade containerized file transfer solution built on SFTPGo providing secure SFTP, FTP/S, and WebDAV access. The system features comprehensive authentication, authorization, quota enforcement, telemetry, and automated TLS certificate provisioning for high availability and scalable user management.

## Technical Responsibilities

- **System Architecture & Configuration**: Designed JSON-based server configurations defining timeouts, hooks, logging, and plugin parameters
- **Containerization**: Developed Docker Compose deployment orchestrating SFTPGo service with persistent storage and dual-interface exposure
- **Database Architecture**: Implemented PostgreSQL backend for user management, permissions, quotas, and audit trails with SSL connections and connection pooling
- **Security Implementation**: Configured multi-factor authentication, session management, rate-limiting, and brute-force protection
- **DevOps Automation**: Implemented ACME-based certificate management, automated restart policies, and telemetry monitoring

## System Architecture

### Container Infrastructure
- **SFTPGo Service**: Go-based SFTP/FTP/WebDAV server in containerized environment
- **Storage**: Persistent volume mounting for configuration and data directory
- **Networking**: Port 2022 (SFTP), Port 8080 (Web Admin/API)

### Data Flow
1. Multi-protocol client connections (SFTP/FTP/WebDAV)
2. PostgreSQL-based authentication and authorization
3. Secure file storage with audit logging
4. Real-time telemetry and monitoring

### Security Features
- Multi-factor authentication integration
- Rate-limiting and brute-force protection ("defender" module)
- SSL/TLS encryption with automated certificate renewal
- Session timeout and access control policies

## Technology Stack

- **SFTPGo (Go)** - Core file transfer server with multi-protocol support
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Container orchestration and deployment
- **PostgreSQL** - User management, audit logs, and metadata storage
- **ACME/Let's Encrypt** - Automated TLS certificate provisioning
- **JSON Configuration** - Centralized runtime configuration management

## Key Technical Achievements

### Security & Compliance
- Implemented robust authentication with MFA and session management
- Configured rate-limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- Established SSL-enforced database connections with connection pooling
- Developed audit trail system for compliance requirements

### Performance & Reliability
- Enabled upload resumption for large file transfers with tuned parameters
- Implemented zero-downtime certificate renewal process
- Configured high-availability setup with automated failover capabilities
- Optimized connection pooling for concurrent user sessions

### Operational Excellence
- Created extensible hook system for workflow automation
- Implemented telemetry pipeline for proactive monitoring
- Designed scalable user management with role-based access control
- Established automated deployment and update procedures

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Network Security Integration
- **Challenge**: Corporate firewall and proxy protocol requirements
- **Solution**: Implemented proxy protocol support with IP whitelisting configuration

### Large File Transfer Optimization
- **Challenge**: Interrupted uploads affecting user experience
- **Solution**: Configured resume capabilities with optimized upload modes and size limits

### Database Connectivity
- **Challenge**: SSL/SNI requirements for database connections
- **Solution**: Implemented SSL mode configuration with proper certificate handling

## Project Impact

Delivered production-ready secure file transfer platform supporting multiple protocols with enterprise security controls. The solution enables rapid user onboarding, scalable file operations, and comprehensive audit capabilities without requiring custom development, significantly reducing operational overhead and security risks.
